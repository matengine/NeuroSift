# NeuroSift
NeuroSift: An open-source software tool harnessing complex-valued matrices for advanced signal analysis in biomedical research. Development in progress

## Introduction
NeuroSift is an open-source tool designed to transcend the limitations of traditional Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in processing intricate neurophysiological signals, particularly EEG. By employing complex-valued matrices to incorporate phase information, NeuroSift provides a more comprehensive representation of signals with pronounced temporal coherence or intricate phase relations.

## Key Features
Complex-valued Matrix Integration: Ensures the encapsulation of phase information.
Comprehensive Representation: Precise decoding of temporal dynamics inherent in biomedical datasets.
Open-Source Development: Championing reproducibility, transparency, and collaborative innovation.

## Applications
1. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): Optimizing the extraction of mental commands from raw EEG signals, thus promising enhanced communication, interaction, and autonomy.
2. Medical Imaging: Offering deeper insights into brain activity, potentially paving the way for early detection of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Preliminary Evidence
Our preliminary experiments reveal the sensitivity of traditional ICA to temporal dynamics, emphasizing the need for an approach attuned to temporal subtleties. NeuroSift's methodology is designed to recognize and process such nuances.

## Getting Started
The official guide for installing and getting started with NeuroSift will be provided soon.
